# Simple React Calculator App

In this app you can click on the buttons and the corresponding symbol will appear in the dark grey box.
When the `=` is pressed, the input gets passed to an `eval()` function and the output appears under the grey line.

You see an _Error_ when you type in an invalid syntax.
